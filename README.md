Swiss Geography: Data Analysis
This project looks at over 2000 Swiss geo data entries for 26 cantons (data 2024). It explores population size, land use, age groups and location (elevation and coordinates). The goal is to understand patterns across different regions using basic statistics, charts, and maps.

---

### Dataset

The dataset has 17 columns with information like:

- Number of residents
- Age group percentages
- Land use (e.g., farmland, forest)
- Location and elevation

Missing data was cleaned and the final dataset was saved for analysis.

### Key Findings

- **Most populated communes**: Zürich, Genève, Basel
- **Least populated communes**: Corippo, Kammersrohr
- **Most crowded cantons**: Basel-Stadt and Geneva
- **Least crowded cantons**: Graubünden and Uri
- **Most communes with working-age people (20–64)**: Bern, Vaud

### Visual Insights

- Bar charts show population size and land use
- Violin plots compare age groups across language regions
- Maps show commune locations by elevation and language

---

### Geography Insights

- High places like Valais have many high-elevation communes
- Language regions match natural borders (Alps, Jura mountains)

---

### Other Highlights

- Created files for each canton
- Built a matrix showing which commune belongs to which canton
- Found that 51% of high-elevation communes are in Valais

---

### Conclusion

This project shows how public data can help us understand where people live, how land is used, and how age and geography vary across Switzerland. Simple tools like plots and maps make the data easy to explore and explain.
